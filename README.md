# pac-man-typing-game

A pac-man-esque game implemented in Python for my 15-112 term project. 
The final version is [TP_V14.py](https://github.com/jessief25/pac-man-typing-game/blob/main/TP_V14.py)

For a walk through the game, watch this video:

Side note: I wrote this before I learned about GitHub for version control, so to see previous iterations you can look at the versions folder.
